<p>My name is Alojz Kovacik. I am a software enginneer with passion for computer graphics, kernel digging and optimization.</p>
<p>My CV available for <a href ="http://kovacik.github.com/downloads/kovacik_ENG.pdf">download</a> (.pdf).</p>

<h4>A brief history</h4>

<p>I attended the Comenius University in Bratislava, where I graduated with B.S. degree in Mathematics
and M.S. degree in Computer Graphics and Geometry.</p>
<p>During the study my foot steps led into a small company - TopSoft s.r.o.. Here I started serious coding on .NET platform.
After the school I joined the GIS team in Softplan Slovakia s.r.o. company, where I did some funky things with
C#, MS SQL, WCS, CIL, LINQ, C++, COM.</p>
<p>After two years of experience in GIS development, I started working for Anasoft APR s.r.o., where 
I was outsourced on quite an interesting project - multiplayer SDK for Microsoft.</p>
